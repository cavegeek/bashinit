bashinit

Common init programs like SysVinit and systemd are huge and slow, but all they
actually do is run bash scripts and other programs.  Bash excels at running
bash scripts and other programs, so bashinit is an init written in bash.

Requirements:
-devtmpfs set to mount on /dev, or a static /dev
-bash
-a few other standard programs

Goals:
-configurable without editing /sbin/init
-a configuration to act as a drop in replacement for SysVinit (or systemd)
-fast bootup
-easy to configure (for experts, not beginners)
